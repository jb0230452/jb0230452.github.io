        <div class="pindex p1">I have been working alongside developers for years testing new applications and web
            services. I have
            recently started my journey learning programming. I have taken Web Development 1 and taken upon myself to
            learn C#. I plan to continue that pathway taking formal classes. I currently work with Tricentis Tosca,
            developing scripts for automation services, so if there are any tasks that you really dislike doing, then
            lets discuss what I can automate for you. </div>
        <div class="pindex p2">Not sure what you are looking for and just want someone to brainstorm with? No problem,
            visit the
            <a href="contactMe.html"><em>Contact Me</em></a> page and I'll contact you to setup a time to have a
            conversation and map out your future
            goals!
        </div>
        <div class="pindex p3">I didn't come from a tech savy family or friends group so you don't need to worry about
            sounding dumb
            asking about how web services work. I am passionate and happy to explain the ins and outs of what can be
            done with your "bigger picture" idea.</div>
